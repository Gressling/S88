This namespace (https://s88.codes) - inspired by the Siemens S88 definition (thank you for that!) - for unit operations, batch information, and experiments is a structured framework used in lab scale, industrial automation, and process control, providing a systematic approach to organizing and managing batch processes. It is adopted to the use in lab and semi-batch environments and so called **Next Generation (NG)**.
