This namespace (https://s88.codes) - inspired by the Siemens S88 definition (thank you for that!) - for unit operations, batch information, and experiments is a structured framework used in lab scale, industrial automation, and process control, providing a systematic approach to organizing and managing batch processes. It emphasizes modularization, reusability, and clear separation between procedural and equipment control, streamlining batch process management and improving efficiency in manufacturing operations. It consolidates many flavors of the common XML-based S88 standard.
